= Delete a Redis instance

If you do not need a Redis instance anymore, you can delete it in the same way as you would with any other object in your cluster:

[source,bash]
----
$ oc delete vshnredis.vshn.appcat.vshn.io my-redis-example
----

IMPORTANT: If you delete the `VSHNRedis` object from the cluster, it will delete the actual instance including all data in it!
