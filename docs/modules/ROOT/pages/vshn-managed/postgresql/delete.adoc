= Delete a PostgreSQL instance

If you do not need a PostgreSQL instance anymore, you can delete it in the same way as you would with any other object in your cluster:

[source,bash]
----
$ oc delete vshnpostgresqls.vshn.appcat.vshn.io my-postgres-example
----

IMPORTANT: If you delete the `VSHNPostgreSQL` object from the cluster, it will delete the actual instance including all data in it!
